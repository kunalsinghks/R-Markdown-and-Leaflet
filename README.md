Week 3 Assignment - Web Page Using R Markdown and Plotly

## Description
The web page produced from the Plotly R Markdown file in this repository shows the location of all of the volcanoes from the cited data set that are located in the North / East semihemisphere - that is, located in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Eastern Hemisphere.  See the plot for a linke to the data source.
The name and the status of each volcano is shown when you hover over it.

### Notes
I had to display the entire world map in order to show all of these volcanoes, as the other choices limit you to specific continents, and these volcanoes are in both Europe and Africa (with a few in the Artic).

Week 2 Assignment - Web Page Using R Markdown and Leaflet

## Description
The web page produced from the R Markdown file in this repository shows the 20 oldest colleges and universities in the United States according to the following article found on niche.com:

http://articles.niche.com/the-25-oldest-colleges-in-america/

I found the icon images on Wikimedia Commons:

For some of these schools, I could find the official logo / seal.  For others, I had to use some other image.  Note that the University of Delaware icon is hard to see on the map because it hides behind Newark or Philadelphia, depending on your zoom level.  The College of Charleston icon is also hard to see.
